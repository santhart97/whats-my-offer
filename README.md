## Topic

For this project, I wanted to implement what I have learned on the Data Analytics Bootcamp by Ironhack to and industry that I am passionate and curious about. So I chose to delve into the automotive industry and to predict the price of a second hand car.
I wanted to see what would the **right** price be for a car I wanted to buy or to sell.

To do this the first step was to find an appropiate dataset I could work with. After much research I found [this](https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes) data set from Kaggle.


## Aim

The aim of the project was to create a model that could predict the *price* of a car given certain variables. 
The purpose of doing this was to find the right offer for the car you are buying or selling.


## Process

1. Exploration and Cleaning 
- I started with 10 different data sets, one for each brand, once I put them together the shape of my dataframe was 101311 rows × 8 columns. Once cleaned the dataframe had 98932 rows × 8 columns.
- I dropped null values and turn the types of columns to floats were necessary.
- The final data looked like this:
